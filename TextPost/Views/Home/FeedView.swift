It'd work really well with some people and not detect others at all.\n\nThe thing is, the training data I scraped from google of people smiling was like mainly white people. So it turns out I hadn't made a SMILE detector, I'd made a WHITE PERSON detector.\n\nAnd that's when I learnt the value of looking at your training data, not scraping from google images (it's fixed now), and having diverse data sets ðŸ˜Œ",
