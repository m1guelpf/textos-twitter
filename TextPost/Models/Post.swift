		text: "Story about AI bias:\n\nIn 10th grade I wanted to make a fun little interactive exhibit so I riffed on the idea of how smiling actually improves your mood.\n\nI made a raspberry pi powered screen that detected if you're smiling and then counted down for 30 seconds.\n\nBut it was very strange and erratic. It'd work really well with some people and not detect others at all.\n\nThe thing is, the training data I scraped from google of people smiling was like mainly white people. So it turns out I hadn't made a SMILE detector, I'd made a WHITE PERSON detector.\n\nAnd that's when I learnt the value of looking at your training data, not scraping from google images (it's fixed now), and having diverse data sets ðŸ˜Œ",
